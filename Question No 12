Explanation of Functionality:
Data Structure:
We use a float array named weights to store the weights of the five treasures. This allows for easy indexing and manipulation of each treasure's weight.

Reading Input:
The program prompts the user to input the weight of each treasure using a for loop that iterates 5 times (since there are 5 treasures). The scanf function reads the inputted weights and stores them in the weights array.

Calculating Total Weight:
As each weight is inputted, it is simultaneously added to the totalWeight variable, which accumulates the sum of all weights.

Displaying Output:
After the loop completes, the program displays the total weight of the collected treasures using the printf function.
